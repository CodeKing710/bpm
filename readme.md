# Bash Project Manager

This manager will allow you to better organize, adjust, configure, and make project folders for any type of project!

Basic functionality: Separate a basic dev-tst-prod environment setup into folders

- |>app
- |---->dp.cfg
- |---->clone.cfg
- |---->app.cfg
- |----> prd
- |----> tst
- |----> dev

intermediate commands local to the respective project folder will run deployment, or use the deployment pipeline stored in the prod folder
